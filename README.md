  With this workout mapper application, you'll be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. Want to log multiple exercises in your workout on any given day? No problem. Want to track the details of your daily workout routines? This is for you. Not into weights and only wanna track your miles ran? Go for it. Think running's lame and that it's all about the GAINZ!? Still good to go. Reach your fitness goals in no time with a fitness tracker built just for YOU. Create new workout plans. Add exercises to existing workout plans. Pick and choose what areas of your routine are most beneficial for your goals with a detailed graphs/stats page. This app does everything short of just working out FOR you (possibly a roadmap feature to be developed at a later date).<br><br>
